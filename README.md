# Git-And-GitHub-Practice
There, we upload my Git or GitHub journey and the topic that was covered.
Any change in GitHub is a committed change.
Committee means saving the screenshots of my file and storing them in memory.  

          Here, we discuss Git and its commands.
  1 Username Register in our git:
            git config-- global user.name "user name";
  2 Register the email address that you used on the github.
            git config-- global user.email "example@gmail.com"
  3 Show the Username and userEmail registered successfully/.
          git  config list
  4 Clone: Cloning a repository on our local machine.
          There are two things that are local(machine or laptop) and remote(That file on Github).
          Clone is used to copy a file from GitHub to the local machine.
     command =>     git clone <-some link of the Project->
